Hi everybody and welcome to my project page.
This is my first GitHub project.

I started studying Java by myself about two weeks ago and I want to realize a simple mobile app for Android (first) and iOS (maybe) to learn new programming languages. I know Android uses Java for coding and I want to start from here. 

The application project is quite simple:
1) data is stored in a SQL Server database
2) data is retrived using PHP and JSON
3) mobile app read data from database and shows informations on screen

What I already know:
1) database structures
2) Apache w/ PHP and JSON
3) few Android Studio basis: code and simple layouts

What I'm looking for:
1) improve and learn new codes and algorithms
2) share my project with the GitHub community
3) learn Java and Android Studio to become indipendent

My project is growing day by day and the I will update further progress. My current work is shown in the issues tab. 

Thanks for your time and contribution. Every hint will be really appreciated!

Alessandro
